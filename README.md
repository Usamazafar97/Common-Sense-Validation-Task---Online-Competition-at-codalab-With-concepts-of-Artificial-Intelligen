# Common-Sense-Validation-Task---Online-Competition-at-codalab-With-concepts-of-Artificial-Intelligence
The task is to directly test whether a system can differentiate natural language statements that make sense from those that do not make sense.Inshort the task is to choose from two natural language statements with similar wordings which one makes sense and which one does not make sense.

Formally, each instance in our dataset is composed of 10 sentences: {s1, s2, o1, o2, o3, r1, r2, r3}. s1 and s2 are two similar statements which in the same syntactic structure and differ by only a few words, but only one of them makes sense while the other does not.

Example:
Task: Which statement of the two is against common sense?
Statement1: He put a turkey into the fridge.
Statement2: He put an elephant into the fridge.
Correct: Statement1
